Virtual machine for the Workflow4Metabolomics
=============================================

This project has for aim to maintain a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) file capable of building a full virtual machine running [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org) and an instance of the [Workflow4Metabolomics](http://workflow4metabolomics.org).

The Workflow4Metabolomics, W4M in short, is a French infrastructure offering software tool processing, analyzing and annotating metabolomics data. It is based on the Galaxy platform.
